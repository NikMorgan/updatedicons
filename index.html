<h1> How Turkey Is Being Squeezed By Russia's War In Ukraine </h1> 

<h2> By Nicholas Morgan </h2>
<br>
<h4> Russia's invasion of Ukraine struck the global economy like an earthquake, sending prices for many basic goods soaring. Turkey, a neighbor with good ties to Russia and Ukraine, has found itself in a difficult middle ground between the two. Below are a set of figures that illustrate how Turkey is supporting Ukraine, but also how the war has been affecting the Turkish economy. </h4>

<h4> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Turkey's approach to the war as part of a "balanced" foreign policy. But this approach has at points upset every side. The U.S. government has warned Turkish banks that continue doing business sanctioned Russian entities may expose themselves to sanctions. Meanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged Turkey to do more to crackdown on Russian ships that it accuses of stealing Ukrainian grain. Finally, Turkish weapons supplied to Ukraine have wreaked havoc on Russia's army since the start of the war and this flow of arms has not abated. The war shows no signs that it is close to an end, but Turkey is likely to keep playing all sides if that is what its leaders decide are in their best interest. </h4>

    <p>Despite Western sanctions levied on Russia’s energy sector, Turkey continues to import significant volumes of Russian energy products. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, Turkey imported more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia throughout 2022, a marked leap from the 98,000 it purchased during the same period a year earlier.</p>

    <p>Turkey was already struggling to bring down its high inflation levels before the war, but the fighting has only made the situation worse. Official inflation data from the Turkish Statistical Institute shows that the Turkish consumer price index rose 83.45% in the last year in September and the price of agricultural products has also risen by 133.41%. There are pre-war factors that exacerbate Turkey’s inflation dilemma, but the war has raised pressure on these prices.</p>

    <p>Russia was the number one source of tourists to Turkey in 2021, and these numbers grew slightly through 2022. In a data release, the Turkish tourism ministry reported that the number of Russians visiting reached 3,003,863. However, the most recent numbers from August show that the number of Russians visiting Turkey fell by 10.99%.</p>

    <p>Throughout the war, a surge of Russians began fleeing to Turkey and began to purchase properties across its cities. Since at least April, Russians have been the largest group of property buyers in Turkey when Russians purchased 1,152 properties and this number peaked at 1,887 in June. The number of Ukrainian buyers also increased during this period, but to a much smaller degree. Ukrainians bought 263 properties in April and that number grew slightly to 301 by June. </p>
